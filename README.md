# mblazonryComponents #

Home of mBlazonry's primary custom component source!



## Includes ##

- The skuid ["progress indicator" sample component](http://help.skuidify.com/m/11720/l/451511?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=11720) code from the skuid docs.

- Barry Schnell's old ["popup controller" custom component](https://community.skuidify.com/skuid/topics/popup-controller-component-disable-x-escape-key-and-hook-dialog-events) code from the skuid community forums.

## Dev Setup ##

This section has two parts. You already did the initial setup part by downloading this repo.

First part:

1.  [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [install](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

2.  From the console you should now be able to run `npm`.

3.  Run `npm install` in this repo's directory, 

4.  That sets up the app, grabbing all dependencies needed by the project and installing them to a local node_modules folder.

5.  If you run any of the automation now you'll get an error saying Gulp needs to be installed globally. So from the repo dir again, run `npm install gulp -g`

6.  Once that's done installing, make sure `npm ls` returns a load of stuff.

7.  Running `gulp` will run the default task of listing all available gulp tasks.

8.  Create a `.env` file in your working directory that containing the following two lines:

	**(case-sensitive)**
    mB_USERNAME="username@org.com"
    mB_PASSWORD="passwordAndSecurityTokenConcatenated"

	You will eventually need to create additional entries for each org you wish to deploy your component packages to.

9. Make sure you can connect to the org with your credentials.

10. To deploy, run `gulp deploy` to automatically build and create the static resource and upload it to SF using jsforce!

11. You should now be good to go. 


### MavensMate [plug-in for editors ](https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate#active-plugins) ###

Choose between using either editor plugins or the standalone mavensmate-app further [below](https://github.com/aklef/mBlazonryComponents#multiplatform-mavensmate-app-standalone).

These are instructions for the Sublime Text 3 mavensmate plugin. These were tested only on Windows 7 64-bit round June 2016. YMMV

1. To deploy, create a mavensmate project using the existing source in your working directory. 

2. Make sure you can connect to the org with your credentials.

3. And set it up like so:
![Mavensmate Project Settings](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13dryEkE4vxSCofTEtOnOmkr0-O4vMv7EawwpWDpU07I/pub?w=952&h=537) 

### [MavensMate-app](https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-app) (Multiplatform & standalone) ###

If running mavensmate v7 or higher, you will need to have this app installed anyways. The mavensmate-app is an Electron-based tool that essentially runs in a webview on any platform and forms a coherent backbone to the few extension of mm for editors.

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/joeferraro/mavensmate-app/releases). Install it, and please make sure it runs.

The UI is essentially the same as for the mm editor plugins so you can follow the procedures listed above or elsewhere.


### Sublime Text 3: Tips ###

1.  If you don't have it already, [install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation), the sublime package manager.

2. Now, we go about installing some packages:

    [sublime-gulp](https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp) (and here's [a guide](https://mijingo.com/blog/run-gulp-from-sublime-text)),
	
	[sublime-jshint](https://github.com/uipoet/sublime-jshint),

    [sublime-jsdocs](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs) (reccommended),

    [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter) (reccommended)

3. With all that installed, you should be able to right-click a file in the FOLDERS tree in Sublime's sidebar [right-click] → Gulp → "List Tasks to Run". That should show the various build options. Run the `default` build and do `Ctrl + ~` on your keyboard to show the console in Sublime, and observe the output.

4. Assuming all went well you should be good to develop mBlazonry's components and use interactive builds!
